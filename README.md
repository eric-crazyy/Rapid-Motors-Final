* **Dynamic User Experience:** Built with the Vue.js framework, ensuring a fast, responsive, and application-like feel that reacts instantly to user input.
* **Secure Backend:** Robust data handling and authorization logic powered by the Laravel framework.

## 🛠 Technology Stack
* **Frontend:** Vue.js, Vue Router, Pinia, Axios
* **Backend:** Laravel (PHP), RESTful API
* **Database:** MySQL (InnoDB)
* **Development Tools:** VS Code, DBeaver, Trello, Wireframe.cc

## 📋 Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
* **PHP** (with Composer for Laravel dependencies)
* **Node.js** (for Vue.js and frontend asset management)
* **Database Management System** (e.g., MySQL, MariaDB, or XAMPP)

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration
Configure your `.env` file with the following database credentials to ensure the application connects correctly to your local environment:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3333
DB_DATABASE=rapid_motors
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=pass
```

## ⚡ Quick Start
To launch the project, execute the `start-dev.bat` file located in the root directory. This will open two command line windows—one for the frontend and one for the backend.
* If the database has not been initialized, the backend command window will prompt you to create it.
* Type `yes` and press Enter.
* Once the services are running, the application will be accessible locally in your browser at **`http://127.0.0.1:8000`**.
